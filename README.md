# C-Starter-Basic-Codes-For-Beginners

Hey there! 👋  
This repository is a small collection of **basic C programs** — perfect for anyone who had just started to learn C programming language.

I created this to help beginners (like me once!) understand the core concepts of the C language through simple, hands-on examples.  
You’ll find programs that cover things like:
- Printing output and taking input  
- Loops and conditionals  
- Arrays, strings, and functions  
- And other small, fundamental exercises

These are the kinds of programs every C learner should try out first.

Thank You for your time , hope you have a good day.
